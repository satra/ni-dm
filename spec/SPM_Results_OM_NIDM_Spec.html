      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software Results Object Model (SPM-ROM) is 
        a <a href="../../../spec/NIDM_Spec.html">
        NI-DM</a> compliant structured representation of the....   
      </p>
      <p>
       	The SPM results specification formally describes the encoding of the SPM results into a 
       	NI-DM representation.

    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        The single conformance class described in this specification is 
        the <dfn>SPM Results Object Model</dfn>, a class of NI-DM formatted objects for describing
        a neuroimaging analysis result created with the <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/">
        SPM</a> software.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The SPM Results Object Model is summarized in Fig. 2.  It consists of an  
        <dfn>inference</dfn> activity which uses both statistical maps and parameters to generate an 
        <dfn>excursion_set</dfn>.  The <dfn>excursion_set</dfn> consists of peaks grouped by the
        <dfn>peak_level</dfn> collection, clusters which contain the peaks and are grouped into a 
        <dfn>cluster_level</dfn> collection, and sets which contain all clusters and are grouped
        into a <dfn>set_level</dfn> collection.

					<h2>height_threshold</h2>
					<p>The parameter entities consist of a unique identifier (typically would be a 
					machine-readable id but has been encoded as a text string here for readability), 
					followed by a prov:label which gives a human readable, short label for the entity.  
					The label is followed by one or more attributes describing the data contained 
					within the entity in the form “namespace:term label”.  
					</p>
					<p>
					In this example we have four attributes.  The first indicates the SPM namespace 
					has defined a term “HeightThreshold” whose value is the term ID defining a 
					height threshold with respect to the SPM software. The second indicates the 
					SPM namespace has defined a term “t-statistic”.  The third indicates the SPM 
					namespace has defined a term “p-value”.  The fourth indicates the SPM namespace 
					has defined a term “pFWER”.  Taken together, the user can completely interpret 
					this entity as some height threshold on a t-statistic with an associated 
					uncorrected p-value and the equivalent family-wise error rate p-value.  Note, 
					a similar syntax (replacing the corresponding entries) would be used if the 
					threshold were to be an f-statistic (spm:f-statistic) with a false discovery 
					rate (spm:pFDR)  p-value threshold correction.

					<h2>extent_threshold</h2>
					<p>The parameter entities consist of a unique identifier (typically would be a 
					machine-readable id but has been encoded as a text string here for readability), 
					followed by a prov:label which gives a human readable, short label for the entity.  
					The label is followed by one or more attributes describing the data contained 
					within the entity in the form “namespace:term label”.  
					</p>
					<p>In this example we have five attributes.  The first indicates the SPM 
					namespace has defined a term “ExtentThreshold” whose value is the term ID 
					defining a extent threshold with respect to the SPM software. The second 
					indicates the PROV namespace has defined a term “label” whose value in this 
					entity is 0.  The third indicates the SPM namespace has defined a term “unit” 
					whose value is “voxels”.  The forth indicates the SPM namespace has defined a 
					term “p-value”.  The fifth indicates the SPM namespace has defined a term “pFDR”.
					</p>
					<p>
					Taken together, the user can completely interpret this entity as some extent 
					threshold with a value of 0 voxels with an associated uncorrected p-value and 
					the equivalent false discovery rate corrected p-value.  Note, a similar syntax 
					(replacing the corresponding entries) would be used if the threshold were to be 
					associated with vertices (spm:unit = vertices) with a family-wise corrected 
					(spm:pFWER) p-value threshold correction.
